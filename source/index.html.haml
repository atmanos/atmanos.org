      AtmanOS compiles ordinary Go programs into images which can be run
      on a hypervisor without a conventional operating system.

    :markdown
      It provides a microkernel and implementation of Go's runtime and standard
      library implemented natively in Go (with a little bit of Assembly).

      It currently targets the Xen hypervisor, allowing the images to be run
      on Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud, IBM SoftLayer, and other cloud providers.

      ## Documentation and resources
